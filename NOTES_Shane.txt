Goals:
1) Get todos fully functional
	- date filtering
	- snoozing modal
	- reminder date/time
		- computed deadline:  use earliest date from set of soft deadline, or hard deadline
		- set duration default to "0.00"
	- recurring reminders
	- sorting by: alphabetical, due date, creation date, priority
	- default order by deadline, priority:
		1. must deadline (important/urgent)
		2. reminders (urgent)
		3. must (important/not urgent)
		4. prefer deadline (not important/urgent)
		5. prefer (not important/not urgent)
		6. completed items by completion date
	- priority visualisation
	- time calculations footer (!done tasks only)
2) Create lists
	- add/view lists to todo
	- view lists w/ full contents
	- set done/not done w/ checkbox
	- make goal
	- set deadlines
	- set active/inactive for filtering
	- take a break menu
	- tags (todos and lists)
	- types: checklist, tasks, bucketlist
	- reordering items in current view 
3) Projects
	- add/view lists to project
	- view project for todos
	- filter todos based on project
	- filter lists based on project
	- color coding by project
	- set active/inactive for filtering
	- task and list dependency?
4) Smarts
	- soft deadline calculations
	- natural language todo creation ("get milk today @ 4pm 30min")
	- reminder alerts
	- self extinguishing tasks
	- basic schedule input (i.e. 14hrs per day)
	- tracking schedule capacity limits
		- update footer to compare time needed vs availabe
	- generate computed start times for soft deadlines (visible)
		- 15min buffer between each
		- 30min after a task should be complete, auto-slip schedule
	- schedule push (recursive rescheduling based on capacity)
	- smart push:  priority, blocking tasks, day usage maximization
	- alert: today's schedule isn't possible, show changes
	- vacation mode (recurring reminder location setting?)
	- enforcing deadlines & capacity limits on list contents
	- project % schedule buckets
	- auto-scheduling based on schedule + buckets
5) Calendaring
	- organize events by time into a time schedule. put non-time deadlined tasks back to back with 15min buffers in between
	- by default, prevent tasks from overlapping specific time slots (unless manually overridden)
	- show day planner view of tasks
	- generate iCal feed for Google Calendar integration
	- import phone calendars
	- prevent collisions with 3rd party calendar elements (possible?)
5) Collaboration
	- authentication
	- sharing
	- assigning owners
==============================================

- optimizations
	- use local storage except for edits (maintain "updated" toggle variable).  only read from parse when changes have been made or on initial app load
	- collection-repeat (for search and “all” views)
	Solution: I switched to a much more complete build system called ionic-generator which utilizes grunt js instead of gulp. Switching reduced the app from 10mb to 3mb, added support for multiple build environments, and provided js linting, ripple, and more.

- bugs
	P2 after editing or updating the side menu functionality breaks

- polish
	- move to slide boxes or gesture events
	- pinchout to add item inline 
	- gesture to take a break menu (pinch in, swipe right, or hold)
	- required field enforcement
	- better cross-platform date and time selector ("clear at top"), "cancel"
	- don't let filters get hidden by search
	- add duration and deadline natural language reader/setter to title
	- convert partial hours into minutes (i.e. .25 = 15min)
	- allow for setting start of week day

========================
- setup angularjs, phonegap templates for sublime
- firebase backend for real-time data sync across devices (online/offline support)?

- questions
	- did calendar widget branch me off beta v14?
