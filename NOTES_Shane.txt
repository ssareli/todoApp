Goals:
========================= v1.0
1) Get todos fully functional
	UX: Today at (Time) for (duration)
	- in next 7 days => “someday in the next 7 days’
	- someday by… => “someday in the next X days”  (inline jog wheel)
	- today => “today...at any reasonable time”
	- on… => “Friday, Jan 30th, 2015”  (inline jog wheel)
	- 15min, 30min, 45min, 1hr, 1:30hrs, 2hrs, 3hrs, 4hrs (inline jog wheel)
	- notifications on/off (default on)

	UX: recurring
	- every 2, every, twice a, 3 times, …, 6 times a [day, week, month]
	- any day of the week, mondays, …, sundays (multi-select list)
	- preferred times: anytime, morning, afternoon, evening, [spec time 15min]

	- UX: make soft deadline selection an event, not a setting 
	- natural language todo creation ("get milk today @ 4pm 30min")
	- self extinguishing tasks (simple reminders)
	- recurring tasks
		- daily/weekly
		- Create hourly per day schedule (I.e. take 15min breaks during Biz hours)
1.5) update ionic  npm update -g ionic

2) Create lists
	- add/view lists to todo
	- view lists w/ full contents
	- set done/not done w/ checkbox
	- make goal
	- set deadlines
	- set active/inactive for filtering
	- take a break menu <button on-hold="onHold()" class="button">Test</button>
	- tags (todos and lists)
	- types: checklist, tasks, bucketlist
	- reordering items in current view 
3) Projects
	- add/view lists to project
	- view project for todos
	- filter todos based on project
	- filter lists based on 
	- color coding by project
	- set active/inactive for filtering
	- task and list dependency?
	- Projects, lists and goals get stack ranked in priority order
5) Collaboration
	- authentication
	- sharing
	- assigning owners
=========================== v1.5
6) Calendaring
	- reminder date/time alerts
		- figure out how to trigger a local notif
		- add new reminder timestamp field (date & time)
		- automatically generate reminders for all tasks with deadline times
			- use todo.deadline as reminder deadline
			- 10min reminder default
				- adjust quantity 
				- minutes/hours/days/weeks
		- deadlines pushes should push reminders
			- add swipes hourly time slot pushes
		- show bell on item in list
		- reminders view in menu
		- Notifications area (read, clear, unread)
	- create day dividers in "this week" view
	- organize events by time into a time schedule. put non-time deadlined tasks back to back with 15min buffers in between
	- by default, prevent tasks from overlapping specific time slots (unless manually overridden)
	- show day planner view of tasks
	- generate iCal feed for Google Calendar integration
	- import phone calendars
	- prevent collisions with 3rd party calendar elements (possible?)

============================ v2.0
7) Scheduler
	- generating a day schedule 
		- parse recurrence table to look for pre-booked events
	- UX: start day with "moment" review of everything planned or auto-scheduled for today and let's confirm, complete, defer, or delete them (any.do) 
	- Soft deadline needs time option
	- basic schedule input (i.e. 14hrs per day)
	- tracking schedule capacity limits
		- update footer to compare time needed vs availabe
	- generate computed start times for soft deadlines (visible)
		- 15min buffer between each
		- 30min after a task should be complete, auto-slip schedule
	- schedule push (recursive rescheduling based on capacity)
	- smart push:  priority, blocking tasks, day usage maximization
	- alert: today's schedule isn't possible, show changes
	- vacation mode (recurring reminder location setting?)
	- enforcing deadlines & capacity limits on list contents
	- project % schedule buckets
	- auto-scheduling based on schedule + buckets
	- Tasks can't go overdue, just get rescheduled (keep scheduling history)Unassigned 


==============================================

- code/perf optimizations
	- combine new and edit views
	- use memory for date hash checks before deadline with local storage
	- use local storage except for edits (maintain "updated" toggle variable).  only read from parse when changes have been made or on initial app load
	- only read/write single records to DB instead of pulling down entire DB every list load
	- ng-options simpler solution for collecting data for selects?
	- collection-repeat (for search and “all” views)
	Solution: I switched to a much more complete build system called ionic-generator which utilizes grunt js instead of gulp. Switching reduced the app from 10mb to 3mb, added support for multiple build environments, and provided js linting, ripple, and more.
	- archive completed items > 30 days old
		- set inactive, filter by active

- bugs
	P1 quick add items don't show up without a refresh
	P1 bug: due date calendar broken on web (can’t select a date)
https://github.com/joshilomas/DatePicker-IonicApp
https://github.com/mrfoh/cordova-datepicker-plugin
	P1 fix duration pre-select option 
	P2 after editing or updating the side menu functionality breaks
	?? Timestamp comparisons are done in GMT, not local, could create issues on filtering?

- polish
	- with hard deadlines, auto set soft to "someday"
	- make todo items aligned using Grid
	- make checkboxes larger icons that toggle states
	- move to slide boxes or gesture events
	- pinchout to add item inline 
	- UX: make adding lots of items quickly super easy, primed
	- gesture to take a break menu (pinch in, swipe right, or hold)
	- UX: adjust to local timezone
	- Ux: hold and move items 
		- create hour dividers in "today" view
	- required field enforcement
	- better cross-platform date and time selector ("clear at top"), "cancel"
	- don't let filters get hidden by search
	- add duration and deadline natural language reader/setter to title
	- convert partial hours into minutes (i.e. .25 = 15min)
	- allow for setting start of week day
	- new task, set hard deadline move soft to “none”
	- offline mode
		- detect when offline and use local storage data
		- add/edit new items to local storage
		- parse items are uneditable (grey color?)
		- back online, all items are synched
	- live sync
	- comments should open a modal to read/write
	- start count-down timer (adjustable)
		- and track time spent
		- offer pause, play
	- clicking search icon auto-opens keyboard
	- UX: send emails to task@tinytask.com from registered email to create items 

========================
- setup angularjs, phonegap templates for sublime
- firebase backend for real-time data sync across devices (online/offline support)?
- upgrade to latest build version  “ionic lib update”

- questions
	- did calendar widget branch me off beta v14?
